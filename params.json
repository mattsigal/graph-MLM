The article pertains to a tutorial for demonstrating methods of visualizing multivariate results with `R`.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, `R` code is provided throughout the article with commentary, and is provided here in fully reproducible form. The code is divided into the following files:\r\n\r\n| Dataset/Topic | R Script | Rendered HTML |\r\n|:-------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|\r\n|      NeuroCog (MANOVA)     |   [NeuroCog-ex.R](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/NeuroCog-ex.R)   |      [NeuroCog-ex.html](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/NeuroCog-ex.html)     |\r\n|      Rohwer (MANCOVA)     |   [Rohwer-MANCOVA-ex.R](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/Rohwer-MANCOVA-ex.R)   |      [Rohwer-MANCOVA-ex.html](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/Rohwer-MANCOVA-ex.html)     |\r\n|     Rohwer (MMRA)    |   [Rohwer-MMRA-ex.R](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/Rohwer-MMRA-ex.R)   |      [Rohwer-MMRA-ex.html](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/Rohwer-MMRA-ex.html)     |\r\n|   SocialCog (MANOVA, Robust MLM)  |   [SC-ex.R](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/SC-ex.R)   |      [SC-ex.html](https://github.com/mattsigal/graph-MLM/raw/master/SC-ex.html)     |\r\n  \r\nQuestions and commentary can be directed to either @friendly or @mattsigal.",
